# Stock Data Extraction and Visualization (Tesla & GameStop)

## Overview
This repository contains a Python-based data analysis project focused on **extracting, cleaning, and visualizing stock market data** for **Tesla (TSLA)** and **GameStop (GME)**.

The project demonstrates real-world data acquisition by combining **API-based data extraction using `yfinance`** with **web scraping techniques**, followed by exploratory data analysis and visualization in **Jupyter Notebook**.

---

## Project Objectives
- Extract historical stock price data for Tesla and GameStop using **yfinance**
- Scrape revenue and financial data from online sources using **web scraping**
- Clean and preprocess financial datasets using **Pandas**
- Visualize stock price trends and patterns over time
- Build practical financial data analysis skills using Python
